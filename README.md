To install:
1. Copy the two textures in this directory to the Texture Packs directory in your minetest folder.
    Example texture pack directory:
    /home/user/.minetest/textures/MineClone-2-Textures/

2. Start (or restart) your MineClone game.


What to do if you do not have a texture pack installed.

1. Create a "textures" directory in your .minetest directory. It MUST be named "textures"!
2. Create a Texture Pack named directory inside of the "textures" directory.
    Example: ~/.minetest/textures/my-texture-pack.
3. Copy the textures from this archive into your new texture pack directory.
4. Go into the "Content" tab of minetest, and scroll down through the Installed Packages, looking for the name that you gave the texture pack
    directory. (ex.: my-texture-pack)
5. Click on the name and enable it by clicking the "Use Texture Pack" button.
6. Start your MineClone game.
7. Enjoy! :D
